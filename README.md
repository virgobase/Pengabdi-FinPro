## STAGE 0 
On this stage, we basically prepare the framework of this project. We have selected the Employee Attrition dataset beforehand, which we downloaded from Kaggle [Employee Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelprashant/employee-attrition)  or you can check on the folder list above.

### Problem
The problem we want to solve is the attrition rate of the company that reached 16.1%. While based on Maier (2015) attrition rate of a company considered to be high if it surpasses 5% within one period (yearly). So, the attrition rate from our dataset is considered high and that becomes our main problem.

### Role
We act as a team of HC Data Scientist who are given order to intervene and analyze the causes of high attrition rates in our company. 

### Goal
Our main goal is to decrease the attrition rate up to 12% within 12 months with structured business recommendation programmes

### Objectives
Here are some objectives to reach our goal:
- Identify factors that cause atrition (features importance)
- Develop predictive models that can estimate the level of attrition of individuals or groups of employees
- Intervening on the causal factors that lead to high employee attrition
- Designing program recommendations for company based on model results

### Business Metrics
Our business metric is Attrition rate.

## STAGE 1
Stage 1 is Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA. In this stage we explore data from descriptive statistic into visualization for a better data and business understanding.

### Descriptive Statistic
We conducted some analysis for checking if there are any missing data, duplicates, incorrect datatype and strange data value in our dataset. Based on the dataset we have [Descriptive Statistic](), there are no missing value and duplicates in our dataset. Hence there are few interesting columns such as, EmployeeCount and StandardHours that show 1 unique value only. While for 'EmployeeNumber', we assumed that the number refers to the employee ID. The only reason why it has a higher number than the total current employees is that the missing IDs are those employees who no longer work at the company.
